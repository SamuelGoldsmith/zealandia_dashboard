1957,Construction on the Lower Karori Dam,Construction of the Karori resivoir bypass overflow,"Excepts from Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Toanga: Since being designated the capital in 1865, Wellington had grown apace. Significant development of the infrastructure was planned and the population was expected to increase rapidly, with immigration schemes already bringing people in. In 1867 the Wellington Town Board started planning a water supply scheme for public use.

The Kaiwharawhara Stream was selected as the source for the water supply, because of its clean water (other streams were being used as sewers) and its elevation (allowing the water to flow by gravity). Work finally got underway in 1872, with the building of a tunnel through Baker's Hill to the head of the Aro Valley and at the other end of the tunnel a distributing basin. Shortage of funds at this point delayed the construction of the dam and so a small weir was placed across the Kaiwharawhara Stream to divert a flow into the tunnel with the distributing basin acting as a reservoir. The houses of Wellington began receiving piped water from this source in May 1874.",historical,https://archivesonline.wcc.govt.nz/assets/display/272020-max?u=8006402cee35c9542c2af77a8b5dd422,https://archivesonline.wcc.govt.nz/nodes/view/675848,-41.29109664,174.7525953

950,Kupe Arrives in Aotearoa,Statue of Kupe on the Wellington waterfront,"According to some tribal narratives, Kupe was the first Polynesian to discover the islands of New Zealand. His journey there was triggered by difficulties with fishing in Hawaiki, his homeland. Apparently the problem was a great octopus belonging to Kupe’s competitor, Muturangi. Kupe set out in his canoe to kill the octopus, and such was the length of the pursuit that it brought him to New Zealand. With a companion known as Ngake (or Ngahue) in another canoe called Tāwhirirangi, he pursued the creature all the way to Cook Strait (known as Raukawakawa), where it was finally destroyed.

3,Māui fishes New Zealand out of the ocean,Māui fishing New Zealand out of the ocean,"Māui is the great trickster hero of Polynesian mythology. Much pre-European Polynesian history is related to this inventive character. Many of the stories are legendary – the theft of fire, the capture of the sun, the pursuit of immortality, the descent into the underworld in search of his father. A central story about Māui tells of how he fished up the North Island of New Zealand. The South Island is referred to as Te Waka-a-Māui, or Māui’s canoe. Rakiura (Stewart Island) is the canoe’s anchor stone and it is said that Māui stood at the peninsula at Kaikōura while he hauled up his prized catch.

5,Te Hokianga-a-Kupe,,"The Polynesian explorer Kupe is said to have returned on his canoe Matawhaorua to Hawaiki from Hokianga – hence the original name Te Hokianga-a-Kupe (the returning place of Kupe). In preparation for the return voyage his people made an earth oven on the harbour shore, but the food was cold, and Kupe cursed and banished them. This place was named Kohukohu (curse). Kupe left behind his taniwha, Ārai-te-uru, in the form of a reef. He also hurled his son Tuputupuwhenua into a spring, where he became a protective taniwha. Kupe named other rocks and places: Ngā Kurī-a-Kupe (Kupe’s dog), Pori Here (genealogical ties) and Ākiha (a taniwha at the mouth of the harbour).",purakau,https://teara.govt.nz/sites/default/files/large_images/m-2388-enz.jpg,https://teara.govt.nz/en/map/2388/places-associated-with-kupe,-35.52786901,173.3628537
1840,"Te Tiriti o Waitangi, The Treaty of Waitangi","The signing of the Treaty of Waitangi, February 6th, 1840","The Treaty of Waitangi was signed on February 6, 1840, at Waitangi in the Bay of Islands. Forty-three Northland Chiefs signed the treaty on that day. Over 500 Māori Chiefs signed it as it was taken around the country during the next eight months.Following its signing, many of the rights guaranteed to Māori in the Treaty of Waitangi were ignored. To help rectify this, the Waitangi Tribunal was set up in 1975. It has ruled on several claims brought by Māori iwi (tribes), and in many cases, compensation has been granted.
