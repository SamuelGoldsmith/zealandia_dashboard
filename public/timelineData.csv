1957,Construction on the Lower Karori Dam,Construction of the Karori resivoir bypass overflow,"Excepts from Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Toanga:Since being designated the capital in 1865, Wellington had grown apace. Significant development of the infrastructure was planned and the population was expected to increase rapidly, with immigration schemes already bringing people in. In 1867 the Wellington Town Board started planning a water supply scheme for public use.

The Kaiwharawhara Stream was selected as the source for the water supply, because of its clean water (other streams were being used as sewers) and its elevation (allowing the water to flow by gravity). Work finally got underway in 1872, with the building of a tunnel through Baker's Hill to the head of the Aro Valley and at the other end of the tunnel a distributing basin. Shortage of funds at this point delayed the construction of the dam and so a small weir was placed across the Kaiwharawhara Stream to divert a flow into the tunnel with the distributing basin acting as a reservoir. The houses of Wellington began receiving piped water from this source in May 1874.",historical,https://archivesonline.wcc.govt.nz/assets/display/272020-max?u=8006402cee35c9542c2af77a8b5dd422,https://archivesonline.wcc.govt.nz/nodes/view/675848,-41.29101142,174.7534087
